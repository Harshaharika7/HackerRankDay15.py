# 📘 Day 15: Linked List | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This repository contains the Python solution for *Day 15* of the HackerRank 30 Days of Code challenge, which focuses on the concept of *Linked Lists* and how to insert and traverse a singly linked list.

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

-You are given a series of integers. 

-Your task is to create a linked list and insert each integer **at the end** of the list. 

-Then, display the contents of the list in order.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Complete the Solution class by:

- Creating a `Node` class with `data` and `next` attributes.

- Implementing the method `insert()` which inserts a node at the **end** of the list.

- Implementing the method `display()` which prints all elements of the linked list in a single line, separated by spaces.

## ✅ Constraints
    
        - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
          
        - 1 ≤ data ≤ 1000 for each test case

## 🔢 Sample Input
    
          4
          2
          3
          4
          1

## ✅ Sample Output

          2 3 4 1

## 💡 Explanation

-The input consists of 4 integers to be inserted into the linked list. 

-After inserting them in order, the list looks like:

        2 → 3 → 4 → 1

-Traversing the list from the head and printing each node's data gives the final output.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Linked List Fundamentals
  
- Node Creation and Pointer Linking
  
- Object Oriented Design in Python
  
- Traversal and Display Logic
  
- Clean and Modular Coding

## 🛠 How to Run

Option 1: With input file

Create a file named `input.txt` with the required input and run:

      python3 linked_list.py < input.txt
      
Option 2: Manual input

Just run:

      python3 linked_list.py
